## Chronological Summary of Key Changes and Design Iterations
1. **Initial Build & Image Error**: Encountered "Failed to construct 'Image'" with Next.js Image; created `CustomImage` component and updated `Navbar.tsx`/`Footer.tsx`, switched social icons to inline SVG.
2. **Static Export Configuration & Asset Errors**: Cleaned `.next`, configured `next.config.js` with `output: "export"`, `trailingSlash: true`, `images.unoptimized: true`; added `serve` and `rimraf` scripts. Removed invalid `plugins` block with `disabled` property in `netlify.toml` to fix parsing errors.
3. **About Page Aesthetic Tweaks**: Iterated heading centering, boxed content, decorative shapes, icon-enhanced cards, Team section, gradient CTA; added then removed reusable `PageHeader` for simpler headers.
4. **Navbar Redesign**: Refactored for white background, centered links, logo left, "Contact Us" button right; removed scroll styles and mobile menu.
5. **Resources Page & Blog Listing**: Switched from full blog listing to static article view; added dynamic card grid filtered by slug; later reverted to single card view with title, date, "Read More".
6. **Blog Post Page**: Removed featured image placeholder; tightened header padding; simplified author display; switched content to Markdown with `renderMarkdown` helper.
7. **Hero & Mission Sections**: Tested low-opacity background image; ultimately placed caretaker image in two-column "Our Mission" section on homepage.
8. **Services Page**: Explored timeline, 3-col grid, then full-width service boxes; removed "Learn More" links, enlarged icons, increased text sizes, focused on three core services, added CTA.
9. **Icon Library**: Added `HeartPulseIcon` and replaced remote monitoring icons on home and services pages.
10. **Careers Page**: Created `/careers/page.tsx` with centered header, description, email link; adjusted padding below navbar.
11. **Contact Page & Footer Form**: In `src/app/contact/page.tsx` and `Footer.tsx`, imported Next.js `Script`, loaded reCAPTCHA API, and inserted `<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="â€¦"></div>` below submit buttons.
